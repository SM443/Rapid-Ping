## Rapid-Ping
I wanted to continuously monitor round trip time in a [NOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_operations_center). The default ping utility for windows does not allow to change interval. So, I took advantage of PsPing utility from Microsoft.
## How to use in Windows?
Download PsPing from [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psping) and `windows_ping.bat` file from this repository and put `psping.exe` and `windows_ping.bat` file at the same location and run it. 

-- Thank You.
